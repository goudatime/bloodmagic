# Bloodmagic Online

Bloodmagic Online is a interactive comic, originally formatted as a scroll comic hosted on webtoon and now interactive on github! Bloodmagic is about a blood pact made between lovers in the late hours of the night, but one will inevitably disappear before morning. Play along to find out who survives the night.



## Project Status
This project is still in the early stages of development. I'm hoping that Bloodmagic will be a genuinely interactive experience that plays with time, parallax, and decisions.
